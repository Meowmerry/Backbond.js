# **Backbone.js Study Notes**

This repository contains my study notes, code examples, and exercises from the **Backbone.js** course on Udemy. Backbone.js is a lightweight JavaScript framework that helps structure web applications by providing models, views, collections, and routing capabilities.

## **What is Backbone.js?**

Backbone.js is a JavaScript library that provides:
- **Models** for binding data and logic.
- **Collections** for grouping models together.
- **Views** for connecting the user interface to models.
- **Routers** for handling navigation and URL routing.
- An **Event-driven architecture** to facilitate communication between components.

---

## **Goals**

- Gain a foundational understanding of Backbone.js.
- Learn how to build modular and maintainable web applications.
- Explore concepts such as Models, Views, Collections, and Routers.
- Understand how to integrate Backbone.js with other libraries like jQuery and Underscore.js.

## **Code Examples**

### **Model Example**
```javascript
const Song = Backbone.Model.extend({
  defaults: {
    title: 'Untitled',
    artist: 'Unknown',
  },
});

const song = new Song({ title: 'Blue in Green', artist: 'Miles Davis' });
console.log(song.get('title')); // Output: Blue in Green
```

### **View Example**
```javascript
const SongView = Backbone.View.extend({
  render: function () {
    this.$el.html(this.model.get('title'));
    return this;
  },
});

const songView = new SongView({ model: song });
songView.render();
console.log(songView.el); // Output: <div>Blue in Green</div>
```
