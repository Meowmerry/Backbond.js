So what is backbone?

In a simple definition, Backbone is a lightweight library for structuring JavaScript code.

Some people regard backbone as an MVC or MV kind of framework.

If you're not familiar with MVC, it's basically an architectural pattern for implementing user interfaces.

It separates the application into three kinds of components a model, a view and a controller.

Hence the name MVC.

The intention is to promote separation of concerns, which results in a better structured and more maintainable

application.

It's not a new concept and has been around since 70s, but it has gained more popularity over the past

ten years, especially in the JavaScript space.

** Backbone does provide the concept of models and views, but backbone views are more like controllers

in the classic MVC. ** 

So that's why I said it's more of a start kind of framework.

And to be more accurate, it's not even a framework.

It's just a library that you can use any way you want.

Bakman also provides a concept called routers, which is used for developing single page applications.

A single page application is a kind of web application that fits in a single web page, aiming to provide

a rich user experience similar to desktop applications in a single page application or spa.

All the necessary code, such as HTML, JavaScript and CSS is retrieved with a single page load.

Any time the user navigates around the website, appropriate resources are dynamically loaded into the

web page.

This provides a very fast and smooth user experience.

Gmail is a very good example of a single page application in Gmail.

The page is loaded once and from that point, any actions you do on the page, such as creating a new

email, replying to an email, deleting emails and so on are done within that page.

Now with backbone you can certainly create a single page application, but you don't necessarily have

to use backbone for that.

You can use backbone models, collections and views to create a perfectly structured and maintainable

rich client application.

Later in this course, as I introduce you to various components of backbone, I will show you real world

examples of websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and we'll show you how you can build something

like that with backbone.

In my experience, backbone works perfectly when you want to build a rich client application over a

set of restful APIs.

I've seen many debates on the web, people comparing backbone with other MVC frameworks such as Knockout

and Angular and arguing which one is better.

In my opinion, none is better than the others.

It's like saying which one is better?

A fork or a spoon?

Neither.

Each is designed for a different purpose.

You can certainly eat everything with either a fork or a spoon, but one works better than the other

in certain situations.

And that's exactly the same with backbone.

So I would suggest learn each of these popular frameworks and get to know their strengths and weaknesses.

And then you decide which one is a better fit for the kind of project you are working on.
